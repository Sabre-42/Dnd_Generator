# Dnd_Generator

This originally started as a project of just learning how to work with and use the topics taught in a c++ class
and ended up turning into a bit of a passion project

Currently able to roll any sided die though a few presents have been created
The typical d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100, and then the custom die 

In development currently is a character stat roller that will allow the user to choose the method that they 
would wish to use for rolling stats, based off a set of generally accepted methods of rolling stats. 

Methods: 
4d6 - Drop Lowest - Reroll 1's
4d6 - Drop Lowest 
3d6 - No Mulligan
3d6 - Reroll 1's
2d6 + 6 

My plan is to morph this into an app that will allow the user to create a full D&D 5e character on the fly
